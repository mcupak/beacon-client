# Beacon Java Client
Java library for accessing Beacon.

## Requirements
### Beacon Schemas (v.0.3.0)
The Beacon client API project is dependent on the [Beacon Schemas](https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team) project. So you
need to have it built in your local repository to successfully build the Beacon client.
